# Python programs

An archive of Python programs I made when learning Python.

These programs were made around 2019 or 2020 while I was learning Python. Feel free to laugh at the code quality and lack of usage of type hints :)

Made some minimal changes in referenced file paths in some programs.

Dependencies are now managed with poetry, as opposed to pip which I used earlier for these programs.

IIRC these programs were originally written in Python 3.6 or 3.7

Tested on Python 3.11.3, all programs work without any issues.
